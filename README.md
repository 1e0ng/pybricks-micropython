Firmware source code and binaries of (selected) Pybricks devices 

This repository is a submodule of our fork of MicroPython. So instead of
cloning this repository directly, do this:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/laurensvalk/micropython

Then you will find this repo at `ports/pybricks` in the `micropython` directory
that was just cloned.
